Small utility to scrape all JSON data for APIs that support pagination and dump everything to a file

### Simple utility to scrape paginated data from APIs that support it
Many a times we need to get a dump of all the data from one of the APIs (looping through the paginated data). 
I was tired of writing this over and over again (for personal projects or hackathons), so publishing this as a utility.

### Input
---
Pass in the base url, to dump all the json data to a file 'all_data.txt'.

### License

Feel free to fork this for whatever need you have.
